Misunderstandings can lead to costly delays and rework. The impact of not communicating effectively can be devastating, both in terms of missed deadlines and budget overruns. Communication needs to be a continuous process, involving everyone from the developers to the project managers and clients. Transparency and setting realistic expectations early on is key.",

This goes beyond just developer notes—everyone involved in the project should be able to access the key information. Documentation isn't just for the code but also for workflows, requirements, and milestones. When people start skipping on documentation, it almost always causes confusion later down the line.",

There’s always the risk of spending too much time on documentation and not enough on actually moving the project forward.

          "comment": "I couldn’t agree more. Automation is great for catching the obvious bugs and ensuring that existing functionality continues to work. But there are so many nuanced bugs that only manual testing can uncover—especially usability issues. In one project I worked on, the automated tests were all passing, but we found major usability flaws during manual testing that weren’t covered by the automation scripts.",

          "comment": "Absolutely. Automated tests are useful for regression testing, but they can’t account for the human element. Manual testing is where you can really think outside the box and use the software in ways the developers might not have anticipated. It’s an essential part of the process, especially when you’re building products that are meant to be used by real people in unpredictable ways.",

              "comment": "Exactly. I think we often underestimate the importance of usability in software development. Automated tests can tell you if a function works, but they can’t tell you if it’s easy to use. That’s why manual testing is so crucial—it gives you the user’s perspective. The best products come from teams that prioritize both types of testing.",
